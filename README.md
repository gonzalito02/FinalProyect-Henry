# FinalProyect-Henry
  
This is my final proyect for graduation on Henry's Institute! Whit my teamwork, we develop all this web page and deploy it!

<br/>
<br/>
  
The proyect is about an e-commerce that allows the owner to manage the store, the sales, and all the features around this business. So too, anyone can enter to see the store of books, do some shoppings, comment and put their opinion about one book, talk whit the support, and a lot of actions more. This project was developed by eigth henry's students. I colaborate mainly doing the forms to create, modify and delete books; the tables for admin and users, dinamyc search-bar and paginated, and other features more!

To see the proyect on your computer, first you must do this:

<br/>
<br/>

 - Clone the proyect.
 - Then you must enter on the command prompt, in the folders "Api" and "Client" on your IDE the following command: "npm i"
 - Once finish installing all the features, introduce: "npm start". This step must do, like the previous step, in both folders.
